# PacMen Factory Assignment
## Directions: To code the checkCollisions function that would bounce pacmen off the walls of the window & specify pacmen position.


### Description:
-This project uses several functions to create pacmen and start the game at the click of a button.

-Once the game is started the pacmen will begin to move in random directions at a fixed velocity towards the window walls and with help of our functions will bounce around the window indefinitely.

### How to run: 
1. Fork repository
2. Clone repo
3. Drag the index.html file onto your browser.
4. Click button in top left hand corner create pacman to create your pacman and then click start to start the game.
5. Click create pacman multiple times to create numerous pacmen.

### Future Improvements
-In the future I would love to play around with the code to make it more interesting/complex. 
-Maybe adding different color pacmen.
-Styling the css of the buttons and background a little more excitingly.
-And adding a button to increase or decrease the velocity of the pacmens speed.

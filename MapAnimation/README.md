# Map Animation/Realtime Bus Tracker Assignment
## Directions: to modify a realtime bus tracker code taught to us in class with our own unique changes.

### Description of the original project:
-This project started as a map centered between Harvard and MIT. 
-When the button was pushed the map would automatically start moving the marker to specified bus stops in their order on the way from MIT to Harvard to simulate the bus route. 

### Description of my version changes:
-Map is centered on the capital of Oahu, HI, Honolulu.
-The first marker is placed near my home in Makiki and the directions will have the endpoint of Kaimanas Beach.
-The map style has been changed to satellite for a different aesthetic.
-As well as the button has also been styled in the seperate CSS in order to make it stand out.
-With each marker move the viewer can see turn by turn the route to the beach.
-The duration of the trip has been sped up to 10x the normal time it would take for the sake of viewing pleasure and time.

### How to run: 
1. Fork repository
2. Clone repo
3. Drag the index.html file onto your browser.
4. Click button in top left hand corner to begin directions from my Home in Makiki, HI to my favorite beach, Kaimanas

### Future Improvements
-In the future I would love to play around with the code to make it more interesting/complex. 
-Perhaps the fetching of real time data from DaBus API could be used to see the route in realtime.
